								<h2>Design and Technology</h2>
								<p>A high school teacher specializing in subjects like industrial technology, material technology, and food 
				                    technology plays a vital role in preparing students for their future. These teachers impart practical, 
				                    hands-on skills that are essential for various careers and life beyond the classroom. Students learn to 
				                    design, create, and problem-solve, fostering creativity and critical thinking. Moreover, these subjects 
				                    offer a bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, making learning more engaging 
			                     	and relevant. As a result, students not only gain valuable technical skills but also develop a strong 
				                    work ethic, attention to detail, and project management abilities, setting them up for success in careers 
			                    	related to manufacturing, engineering, or culinary arts.</p>

									<h3>Food Technology</h3>
									<p>The study of Food Technology provides students with a broad knowledge of food properties, 
									processing, preparation, nutritional considerations and consumption patterns. It addresses 
									the importance of hygiene and safe working practices and legislation in relation to the production 
									of food. Students develop food-specific skills, which can be applied in a range of contexts 
									enabling students to produce quality food products. The course also provides students with contexts 
									through which to explore the richness, pleasure and variety food adds to life and how it contributes 
									to both vocational and general life experiences.</p>

									<h3>Material Technology</h3>
									<p>The study of Textiles Technology provides students with knowledge of the properties, performance 
										and uses of textiles. They explore fabrics, yarns, fibres and colouration. Students examine the historical, 
										cultural and contemporary perspectives on textile design and develop an appreciation of the factors 
										affecting them as textile consumers. Students investigate the work of textile designers and make judgements 
										about the appropriateness of design ideas, the selection of materials and tools, and the quality of textile 
										items. Textile projects give students the opportunity to be creative, independent learners and to explore 
										functional and aesthetic aspects of textiles.</p>

									<h3>Industrial Technology</h3>
									<p>The study of Industrial Technology provides students with opportunities to engage in a diverse range of 
										creative and practical experiences using a variety of technologies widely available in industrial and 
										domestic settings.Students develop knowledge and understanding of materials and processes. Related 
										knowledge and skills are developed through a specialised approach to the tools, materials, equipment 
										and techniques employed in the planning, development, construction and evaluation of quality practical 
										projects and processes. Critical thinking skills are developed through engagement with creative practical 
										problem-solving activities.</p>
