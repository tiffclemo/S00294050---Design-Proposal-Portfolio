											<p>I'm Tiffany Clements, born on the 11th of October 1996.
											I began my teaching career at the age of 18, finishing my HSC as I completed 
											my certificate three in Early Childhood Education and Care. I continued with 
										    this career for seven years, studying my Bachelor of Early Childhood. 
											In the mist of the Coivd-19 Outbreak, I felt like I could be doing more, feeling 
											lost and unsure, I started a six month course to stimulate my brain and see if i was 
											capable of more. Guided by my passion for education, I began my double degree, Bachelor
											of Education (Secondary) / Bachelor of Arts (Technology). The four year journey began
											in 2021, currently in my third year, embarking on fulfilling my path to nurturing 
											and stimulating our future generation. </p>

												<h2>Welcome to My Teaching Portfolio</h2>
											</header>

											<p>From a very young age, my heart was captivated by the art of teaching. Now, 26 years of age I am moving towards my dream of becoming a secondary highschool teacher. 
												After spending seven years as an Early Childhood Educator, I felt like i had potential for more, I knew I needed to move on and decided that High School Teaching was the way to go.

											<h7>'Our Big Loud Family'</h7><p></p>

											<p>I grew up with four older siblings and a younger brother. 
												We have always had a very loud and proud family, I became an Aunty at five years old.
												Moving forward to 2023 I am now a doting Aunty to eleven gems. 
												Being an Aunty so young, i grew up surrounded by chilren.
												Throughout the years I learnt so many life skills that I have continued to utilise through the realm of teaching. 
												I believe that building strong and respectful relationships with your students builds the foundation for a postive and effective learning environment.
												I am convicned that the life skills I built through being an Aunty and God Mother have assisted me in my teaching pedagogy and representation.<p>
